This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Collosal Landing Page-Live Demo

The design does not include tablet or mobile versions, so opening via a laptop or desktop is recommended.

The live demo can be accessed [here](https://collosal-landing-page-codedesign-dev.vercel.app/).

## Credit

The challenge to create this landing page is obtained from [codedesign.dev](https://codedesign.dev/). You can find the challenges and design assets used to create this page at [here](https://codedesign.dev/challenge/collosal).

The UI and components on this landing page were created and designed by [Nauval at Figma](https://www.figma.com/@mhd). Please visit the designer's profile at https://www.figma.com/@mhd to see more of his creations.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
